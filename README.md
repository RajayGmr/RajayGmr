👋 Hi, I’m Rajay Ghimire (@RajayGmr)

👀 I’m interested in data analysis, data engineering, and applied data science—turning raw data into insights and reliable systems.

🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, Python, data pipelines, and statistical analysis, with a growing focus on machine learning fundamentals.

💞️ I’m open to collaborating on data-driven projects, analytics dashboards, ETL pipelines, and real-world problem-solving using data.
